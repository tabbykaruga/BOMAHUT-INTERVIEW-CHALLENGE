BOMAHUT INTERVIEW CHALLENGE

## a) Write an algorithm that given an M X N  matrix return all numbers that are the maximum value inits row but the minimum in its column
# solved in algorithim.py

For example if given the matrix
Input:matrix = [[5,16,20],[9,11,18],[15,16,17]]
Output:[17]
Explanation:17 is the only number since it is the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column.

Input:matrix = [[100,60,20, 50],[70,80,10,90],[10,50,44,30]]
Output:[50]
Explanation:50 is the only number since it is the maximum in its row and the minimum in its column.

Constraints:
● m == mat.length
● n == mat[i].length
● 1 <= n, m <= 50
● 1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105.
● All elements in the matrix are distinct.

## b) What is the space and time complexity of your solution? 
# Explained in complexity file

## c) Write 1-2 tests that you run to validate your answer.
# Test in Test.py
