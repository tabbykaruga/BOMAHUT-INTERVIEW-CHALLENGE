TIME COMPLEXITY

The time complexity of find_max_min() is O(nm), where n is the number of rows in the matrix and m 
is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because it loops through each row of the matrix and 
then finds the maximum value in that row, which takes O(m) time. As a result, the overall time 
complexity is O(nm).


SPACE COMPLEXITY

The space complexity of find_max_min() is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This is 
because the code creates a list of length n to store the maximum value of each row. Since it does not 
create any other data structure with respect to the size of the matrix, the space complexity is only 
dependent on the number of rows.
